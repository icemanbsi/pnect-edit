Nothing in this Agreement intends to transfer any such intellectual property rights to you. You will not take any action to jeopardize, limit or interfere with UniProgy's rights.

Subject to the terms of this Agreement, UniProgy hereby grants you a limited, personal, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable, non-assignable license to download, install and use one instance of the Software and to use it on only one domain name extension (e.g. .com, .net, or .org).
